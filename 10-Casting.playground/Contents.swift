To downcast to the subclass type with a type cast operator
(as? or as!).
 
 Use the conditional form of the type cast operator (as?) when
 you arenâ€™t sure if the downcast will succeed. This form of
 the operator will always return an optional value, and the
 value will be nil if the downcast was not possible.
 
 Use the forced form of the type cast operator (as!) only when
 you are sure that the downcast will always succeed. This form
 of the operator will trigger a runtime error if you try to
 downcast to an incorrect class type.
